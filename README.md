## Features ‚ú®

- **Spotify Integration**: Seamlessly connects with your Spotify account
- **Machine Learning Analysis**: Analyzes your music preferences using content-based filtering
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generates a playlist based on the similarity of the songs you are listening to
- **Automatic Playlist Creation**: Creates and saves custom playlists directly to your Spotify account
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, very minimalistic, responsive interface with Spotify-like design
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear 3-step process with visual feedback

## How It Works üîç

1. **Connect**: Link your Spotify account to grant RecomML access to your listening history
2. **Train**: Our machine learning model analyzes your music preferences from your spotify account
3. **Generate**: Get personalized track recommendations and a custom playlist

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Frontend**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Spotify OAuth
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Machine Learning**: Content-based filtering algorithm
- **API**: Node.js/Express backend

## Machine Learning Algorithm üß†

The recommendation system uses a sophisticated content-based filtering approach that combines multiple techniques:

1. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**

   - Used for analyzing track names and artist names
   - Helps identify important terms that characterize each song

2. **String Similarity Analysis**

   - Compares track names and artist names using string similarity metrics
   - Helps find songs with similar titles or by similar artists

3. **Feature-based Similarity**

   - Track name similarity (30% weight)
   - Artist name similarity (30% weight)
   - Token-based similarity (20% weight)
   - Popularity score similarity (20% weight)

4. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Tokenization of track and artist names
   - Case normalization
   - Genre analysis

The algorithm processes your listening history to create a unique musical profile and finds songs that match this profile based on the weighted combination of these features.
